# 42_ Get_Next_Line

For this project we had to create a function that reads a file and allows you to read a line ending with a newline character ('\n') from a file descriptor without knowing the size beforehand. When you call the function again on the same file, it grabs the next line. 

This project deals with static variables, memory allocation in both stack and heap memory and when to free and allocate memory to prevent leaks. 

A (-1) is returned if an error occurred and a (0) if the file is finished reading. If a line is read it returns a (1).
